3. Select top 3 per month

**Top Negative Employees:**
1. Sort by monthly sentiment score (ascending)
2. Secondary sort by employee name (alphabetical)
3. Select top 3 per month

### 3.3 Results Summary
**Overall Top 3 Positive Employees:**
1. lydia.delgado@enron.com (Score: 7.6)
2. john.arnold@enron.com (Score: 7.3)
3. patti.thompson@enron.com (Score: 6.2)

**Overall Top 3 Negative Employees:**
1. bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com (Score: 4.9)
2. rhonda.denton@enron.com (Score: 4.6)
3. kayne.coulter@enron.com (Score: 4.0)
